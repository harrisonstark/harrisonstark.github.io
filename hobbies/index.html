                            Early on in high school, I shared tea with one of my friends and, when 
                            COVID hit around my Junior year, I started a tea club. There I presented and shared facts about 
                            different types of tea, teaware, and gave an overall introduction to tea. I've persisted those 
                            slides in Google Drive, available <a class="project-link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VXj_psMcnRwG2uxPVOKbpR31NBL0y5--?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. 
                            Since then, I've collected teaware that I love and use often. Additionally, I've placed orders to 
                            both China and Japan to dive into the unique styles of tea found across both countries. 
                            I've found that my tastes tend to lean more toward Japanese green teas. I can definitely say that my 
                            favorite so far have been bancha, specifically kyobancha. Below I've placed a 
                            collection of images related to tea along with a description of each.

                            Before my Junior year of high school, I had nearly no interest in reading. My Junior year of high school 
                            was formative for a number of reasons, however with regards to reading, my English teacher, Mr. Hale, 
                            had a massive impact. During high school, I always tried to get the best grades, complete assignments 
                            exactly as required, and for my English class with Mr. Hale, that meant looking for deeper meaning in 
                            the text and analyzing it to a level that I hadn't been required to do before. Through his assignments, 
                            I found an enjoyment from reading. I perhaps treated it as a sort of treasure hunt, searching each sentence 
                            for things like analogies, hyperboles, etc., but that doesn't take away the fact that it inspired me to go 
                            into my parents' library and pick out some books that seemed interesting: Dan Brown's novels. I began with 
                            <em>The Davinci Code</em> and quickly completed the rest of the series. I enjoyed his writing style, especially 
                            with switching between characters for each chapter, building suspense throughout the story. During Mr. Hale's 
                            class and in the following year, we were required to analyze a number of authors' works. From Kendrick Lamar 
                            to Haruki Murakami, I thoroughly enjoyed learning English, something my parents would have said was impossible 
                            for me to do at any point prior. In my Senior year of high school, we analyzed Haruki Murakami's short stories. 
                            A few that I remember are <em>Birthday Girl</em> and <em>The Second Bakery Attack</em>. I was enthralled with his 
                            writing style, and I slowly purchased every book that he had written, both fiction and non-fiction. 
                            After having moved three times with all of my books, I realized that I needed a better solution than physical media. 
                            I did a lot of research and ended up purchasing a Nook Glowlight 4e from Facebook Marketplace which I currently use 
                            for reading. I read mostly on the train to and from work, however there's something about reading in bed 
                            with natural afternoon light shining through the window on the weekends that I love.

                            TODO: Info about games. My goal from the time I graduated and was 
                            financially stable, about two months after moving, was to complete 
                            every Pokemon game in which there was some semblance of a story to 
                            finish. Note that if there are multiple games in a generation, I 
                            generally picked only one. Below, my progress is outlined. I may be
                            missing some, however this list will be updated often.
